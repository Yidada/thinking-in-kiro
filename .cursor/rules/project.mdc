Every time you start a development cycle, follow these steps:
1.Create a workspace folder
  - Under the project’s root, inside the .dev directory, create a new subfolder named with the current date and a sequential number (e.g. 2025-07-20-01) to hold all files for this cycle.
2.Draft a requirements file
  - Generate a requirement.md document that analyzes the user’s current needs.
  - If any context is missing, proactively ask the user to clarify before proceeding.
3.Review requirements with the user
  - Share the requirement.md with the user and wait for them to verify that you’ve understood their needs correctly.
  - Do not move on until they give explicit approval.
4.Produce a design document
  - Based on the confirmed requirements, create a design.md outlining the proposed technical solution.
5.Review design with the user
  - Send the design.md to the user and wait for their feedback and approval before continuing.
6.List implementation tasks
  - From design.md, generate a todo.md that clearly enumerates each task required to build the solution.
7.Review task list with the user
  - Share the todo.md and wait for the user’s sign-off.
  - Again, do not proceed without explicit confirmation.
8.Execute tasks in order
  - Work through the todo.md items one by one.
	- If you hit any uncertainty, consult the user immediately.
	- Once a task is done, mark it with strikethrough in todo.md.
9.Summarize completion
  - After all tasks are marked complete, create a done.md under .dev that lists every finished item.
10.Notify the user
  - Let the user know that all tasks are complete and the cycle is finished.
